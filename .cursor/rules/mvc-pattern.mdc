# MVC Pattern

When creating code consider how to structure the architecture using the MVC pattern.

## Overview

Here are the objects that make up the MVC pattern:

Models - A purely data object. However, often times they will include "observable" variables that can be observed for changes. An observable wrapper is often used to notify observers when the variable changes.
Views - A visual representation of the model.
Controllers - A controller will often contain the logic for the MVC pattern. It will contain the logic for the event listeners and the logic for the data flow.
Services - A service is a class that contains the logic for the application. It is often used to abstract the data source or to contain the logic for a specific task.
Service Providers - A service provider is a class that contains the logic for the application. It is often used to abstract the data source or to contain the logic for a specific task.

## Flow

The flow of the MVC pattern is as follows:

1. The Application is initialized.
2. The Application starts by creating and initializing an Application Service Provider.
    a. The Application Service Provider will be globally accessible.
    b. The Application Service Provider is used to create various required services.
3. The Application Service Provider will create and initialize a Scene Manager Service.
    a. The Scene Manager Service will be globally accessible.
    b. The Scene Manager Service will be responsible for loading and unloading scenes.
    c. The Scene Manager Service will be responsible for managing the active scene.
4. The Scene Manager Service will load a scene.
    a. Each scene will have its own Scene Service Provider.
    b. The Scene Service Provider will create a Scene Controller.
    c. The Scene Controller will be responsible for creating models, views, and controllers.
    d. The Scene Controller can hold references to models, views, and controllers.
    e. Controllers can reference the Scene Manager Service to load and unload scenes.
5. Step 4 will continue to repeat until the application is closed.
    a. At any time, controllers can quit the application by calling the Application Service Provider's quit method.
